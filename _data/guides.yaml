  - category: Writing Extensions
    cat-id: writing-extensions
    guides:
      - title: Writing Your Own Extension
        url: /guides/extension-authors-guide
        description: |
          Quarkus extensions add a new developer focused behavior to the core offering, and consist of two distinct parts, buildtime augmentation and runtime container. The augmentation part is responsible for all metadata processing, such as reading annotations, XML descriptors etc. The output of this augmentation phase is recorded bytecode which is responsible for directly instantiating the relevant runtime services.
          
          This means that metadata is only processed once at build time, which both saves on startup time, and also on memory usage as the classes etc that are used for processing are not loaded (or even present) in the runtime JVM.

        url: /guides/performance-measure
        description: When measuring the footprint of a Quarkus application, we measure Resident Set Size (RSS) and not the JVM heap size which is only a small part of the overall problem. The JVM not only allocates native memory for heap (`-Xms`, `-Xmx`) but also structures required by the jvm to run your application.

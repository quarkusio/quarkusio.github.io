        <p>The main objective of this working group is to allow AI features in Quarkus Dev Mode (Dev UI and CLI)</p>
        <h3>The Problem</h3>
        <p>The way developers write code is changing with the rise of AI tools like chatGPT, etc. Developers now ask an AI agent to help with tasks.</p>
        <h3>The proposed Solution</h3>
        <p>Provide a way to allow AI integration into Quarkus Dev Mode (Dev UI and CLI) . They should enable extensions to to contribute to the AI hooks.</p>
        <p>Quarkus core should allow hooks (BuildItems) that extensions can use to define AI functions.</p>
        <p>The chappie extensions will use this and set it up in Dev UI. The Chappie extension will also be responsible for an indexed vector DB that contains the Quarkus documentation. Extensions should be able to use this with groupId and artifactId.</p>
        <p>The Chappie extension will manage the backend configuration, connection (to the LLM), and the elements in the Dev UI.</p>
        <p>Extensions will provide relevant AI functions.</p>
        <p>Adding a chatbot can also be added.</p>

      short-description: |
        Observability.Next is a strategic initiative to modernize the observability stack within the Quarkus framework, aiming to streamline and enhance its ability to monitor and manage distributed systems.
      readme: |
        <h2>Overview</h2>
        <p>Observability.Next is a strategic initiative to modernize the observability stack within the Quarkus framework, aiming to streamline and enhance its ability to monitor and manage distributed systems. Currently, Quarkus (3.16.x) leverages the following components for observability:
        Metrics: Managed through <a href="https://micrometer.io/">Micrometer</a>, which supports multiple registries (e.g., Prometheus) to expose application metrics.
        Tracing: Handled via the OpenTelemetry (OTEL) SDK, enabling distributed tracing data to be exported to an OTEL collector.
        Logging: JBoss's LogManager with a handler forwarding logs with OTEL.</p>
        <p>While OpenTelemetry is the industry standard for observability, both in protocol and format, the OTEL SDK has proven challenging to adapt due to its design for agent-based observability. In a framework like Quarkus, more granular and direct control over observability is required to monitor application performance, reliability, and user experience effectively.</p>
        <p>Micrometer, the de-facto Java standard for metrics, has recently proposed an enhanced, global approach to observability with the new Observation API. Expanding Micrometer’s role in Quarkus’ observability stack represents an opportunity to simplify implementation and maintenance while preserving compatibility with leading observability tools.</p>
        <h2>Objectives</h2>
        <p>The Observability.Next initiative seeks to strengthen the integration of Micrometer’s evolving Observability API within Quarkus, aligning it with OpenTelemetry’s protocol standards. Key objectives include:</p>
        <ul>
        <li>Enhanced Observability Control: Implement a framework-native, Micrometer-centric approach to metrics, traces, and logs, ensuring developers have more refined control over observability components without the limitations of the OTEL SDK.</li>
        <li>Broader Metrics and Tracing Compatibility: Continue exposing metrics to various registries, including Prometheus, while maintaining OTEL compatibility for metrics and tracing protocols.
        Improved Performance and Reliability: Define and measure performance baselines of the current observability setup and compare them against the next-to-be Micrometer Observation API and OTEL bridge integration to ensure tangible performance and reliability improvements.
        Continue to support components using Micrometer metrics API or Open * Telemetry SDK (like Pulsar)</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Scope</h2>
        <p>Observability.Next will unfold across multiple phases, each handled by specialised working groups. The scope of the initial working group will include:</p>
        <ul>
        <li>Micrometer Observation API Integration: Introduce and integrate Micrometer’s observability API as a foundational layer</li>
        <li>Transformation to OTEL Protocols: Develop a mechanism to translate Micrometer-collected observations into OTEL-compatible metrics, traces, and logs, ensuring smooth interoperability with OTEL-based tools and collectors.</li>
        <li>Performance Benchmarking: Establish a performance baseline for Quarkus’ current observability model, comparing it against the new Micrometer-based observability API and OTEL bridge to quantify gains and identify areas for further optimisation.</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Expected Outcomes</h2>
        <ul>
        <li></li>
        <li>Improved Developer Experience: More intuitive, refined control over observability for Quarkus developers, reducing complexity and overhead associated with setting up and maintaining observability.</li>
        <li>Ecosystem Compatibility: Continued compatibility with existing observability tools such as Prometheus and OTEL collectors, ensuring interoperability with common enterprise monitoring solutions.</li>
        <li>Less breakage due to the OTEL SDK</li>
        <li>More control over the semantic convention in span and metric tags</li>
        <li>Performance Gains: Potentially lower latency and resource consumption in observability operations, contributing to Quarkus’ goal of high-performance, cloud-native applications.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Some concrete features we would get at the framework level:</p>
        <ul>
        <li>Instrument once, plug different frameworks later</li>
        <li>Better support of scopes than the one we have today. See:
        https://github.com/quarkusio/quarkus/issues/25102 and
        https://github.com/quarkusio/quarkus/issues/37140</li>
        <li>Auto-generate metrics documentation from source code instrumented with it.</li>
        <li>A way to manage semantic conventions</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Users would benefit from:</p>
        <ul>
        <li>A way to manage their metrics schemas.</li>
        <li>Yet a new framework is available if they want to use it.</li>

      short-description: |
        This working group will explore and define the foundation of the next generation of AI-Infused and Agentic applications built with LangChain4j and Quarkus LangChain4j. The group will investigate core changes to the current programming model, improve dev exp, build stronger interoperability.
      readme: |
        <h3>1. Summary</h3>
        <p>This working group will explore and define the foundation of the next generation of <strong>AI-Infused</strong> and <strong>Agentic applications</strong> built with LangChain4j and Quarkus LangChain4j. The group will investigate core changes to the current programming model, improve developer experience, build stronger interoperability mechanisms (especially around A2A), and define architectural separation of responsibilities (e.g., executor vs planner). The output will serve as the foundation for building resilient, scalable, and extensible AI-infused and agent systems on the Quarkus platform.</p>
        <h3>2. Motivation</h3>
        <p>While LangChain4j and Quarkus LangChain4j already provide strong foundations, building real-world agentic applications has revealed several pain points and architectural limitations. These range from ergonomic and modeling issues to missing runtime support for observability, visualization, memory management, and resilience.</p>
        <p>This WG aims to:</p>
        <ul>
        <li>streamline the developer experience,</li>
        <li>improve core primitives (invocations, workflows, A2A),</li>
        <li>enable pluggable planning <em>engines</em> (like the built-in workflow constructs, supervisor…),</li>
        <li>strengthen memory and context engineering support,</li>
        <li>and provide around cost, observability, and correctness features</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>3. Scope</h3>
        <p>This working group will cover the following areas:</p>

    - title: "Quarkus to the CommonHaus Foundation"
      board-url: "https://github.com/orgs/quarkusio/projects/38"
      short-description: |
        Work needed around moving Quarkus to foundation and streamline open governance.
      readme: |
        <p>from Discussion at https://github.com/quarkusio/quarkus/discussions/43013</p>
        <p>We started the move of Quarkus to a foundation <a href="https://quarkus.io/blog/quarkus-in-a-foundation/">earlier this year</a> and recently <a href="https://quarkus.io/blog/quarkus-moving-to-commonhaus/">set the direction</a> towards <a href="https://www.commonhaus.org/">CommonHaus</a> and during the summer break the CommonHaus council <a href="https://github.com/commonhaus/foundation/pull/183">approved our request</a> to join.</p>
        <p>Thus, now the real work starts, and it's just fitting we set up a working group for the effort getting Quarkus to CommonHaus foundation.</p>
        <h1>Goal</h1>
        <p>Two parts</p>
        <ul>
        <li>setup Quarkus to have transparent and open governance</li>
        <li>Go through the few but important requirements for a CommonHaus project.</li>
        </ul>
        <h1>Initial work items/questions:</h1>
        <p>Current known list, but not limited to:</p>
        <ul>
        <li>identify design communication channels (i.e. #41973)</li>
        <li>which repositories / code will move</li>
        <li>impact (if any) on quarkiverse projects</li>
        <li>how will trademarks work/change</li>
        <li>identify running services and setup/maintain them (registry.quarkus.io, code.quarkus.io etc.)</li>
        <li>add required metadata/files to the various repositories</li>
        </ul>
        <h1>Tracking</h1>
        <p>We will use the working group board to track publicly all the known relevant work and questions.For the few exception cases where, for legal or personal constraints, the work must happen in private, we will post the outcome and results in public places (like a GitHub discussion of a GitHub issue tracked on the working group board).</p>
        <h1>When will this working group be done?</h1>
        <p>When Quarkus has an active working governance model in place and all major work items around setting up Quarkus at CommonHaus are completed - after that, its expected things will just be iteratively improved, and the dedicated working group will not be needed (others might start to continue more specific efforts).</p>
        <p>The majority of the work must be done before the end of December 2024. The latest deadline for CommonHaus is April 2025, when the bootstrap period of CommonHaus ends.</p>

    - title: "Test classloading"
      board-url: "https://github.com/orgs/quarkusio/projects/30"
      short-description: |
        The goal of this working group is to rewrite Quarkus's test classloading, so that tests are run in the same classloader as the application under tests, and Quarkus extensions can do "Quarkus-y" manipulations of test classes.
      readme: |
        <p>At the moment, Quarkus tests are invoked using one classloader, and then executed in a different classloader. This mostly works well, but means some use cases don't work: extensions cannot manipulate test classes in the same way that they do normal application classes. For example, anything run via a JUnit @TestTemplate test case will see the un-transformed class.</p>
        <p>It also means we have extra user-facing complexity, such as the QuarkusTest*Callbacks](https://quarkus.io/guides/getting-started-testing#enrichment-via-quarkustestcallback):</p>
        <blockquote>
        <p>While it is possible to use JUnit Jupiter callback interfaces like BeforeEachCallback, you might run into classloading issues because Quarkus has to run tests in a custom classloader which JUnit is not aware of.</p>
        </blockquote>
        <p>A final benefit is a reduction in the internal complexity of our code. Hopping between classloaders during test execution takes a lot of work, and adds a lot of code! It also is brittle in places. For example, because the hop between classloaders relies on serialization in some cases, it's becoming harder to do as the JVM tightens up security restrictions. We used to rely on xstream, but that stopped working in Java 17. In https://github.com/quarkusio/quarkus/pull/40601, @dmlloyd moved us to use the JBoss Serializer, which works better, but might still be affected by future restrictions on class access.</p>
        <p>The goal of this working group is to allow test classes to fully participate in the 'quarkification' of classes. The mechanism for this is probably just to load the test classes with the classloader we intend to run them with, so that JUnit sees the 'correct' version of the class.</p>

    - title: "Spring-Style Testing"
      board-url: "https://github.com/orgs/quarkusio/projects/60"
      short-description: |
        Enable Spring developers to migrate to Quarkus with minimal friction by exploring and providing compatibility layers for the most common Spring testing patterns. So they don’t need to rewrite their existing tests.
      readme: |
        <h3>Problem Statement</h3>
        <ul>
        <li>Spring developers rely heavily on testing constructs like @SpringBootTest, MockMvc, TestRestTemplate, and slice-based testing.</li>
        <li>Quarkus, while offering its own solid testing ecosystem (e.g., @QuarkusTest, RestAssured, and Continuous Testing), doesn’t align with Spring-style testing by default.</li>
        <li>This mismatch forces developers to rewrite or adapt tests when switching to Quarkus.</li>
        <li>Reducing this friction aligns with Quarkus’s goal of enabling Spring developers to migrate without starting from scratch.</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Proposed Solution</h3>
        <ol>
        <li>Survey and identify the Spring testing APIs and techniques most widely used, across unit, controller (HTTP), and integration tests.</li>
        <li>Map these to their closest equivalents in Quarkus testing infrastructure (e.g., @QuarkusTest, @QuarkusIntegrationTest, RestAssured).</li>
        <li>Prototype mechanisms that allow Spring-style tests to run with minimal or no modifications in Quarkus (e.g., helper annotations, compatibility layer, quarkiverse library, tooling adaptation).</li>
        <li>Define a realistic scope—supporting the most used constructs only (not all of Spring’s testing API).</li>
        </ol>
        <h3>Definition of Done</h3>
        <p>The WG will be considered complete when the following are delivered:</p>
        <ul>
        <li>A prioritized list of Spring testing patterns (usage-informed).</li>
        <li>A mapping document detailing how each pattern corresponds to Quarkus approaches.</li>
        <li>A working prototype or POC illustrating compatibility (e.g., a mini-project demonstrating Spring tests running in Quarkus).</li>
        <li>PRs to Quarkus implementing support or helper utilities.</li>
        <li>A migration-style guide/documentation (“How to run your Spring tests in Quarkus”).</li>
        <li>A community-facing artifact (e.g., blog post, talk, or demo).</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Scope</h3>
        <h3>In Scope</h3>
        <ul>
        <li>Inventory &amp; prioritization of widely-used Spring testing APIs (unit, HTTP controller, integration).</li>
        <li>Feasibility analysis and prototyping for compatibility.</li>
        <li>Documentation drafting and an example project.</li>
        <li>Coordination and communication (issues, discussion threads, milestones).</li>
        </ul>
        <p>⠀</p>
        <h3>Out of Scope</h3>
        <ul>
        <li>Full support for the entire Spring testing API surface; treating edge cases is not critical.</li>
        <li>Deep re-architecting of Quarkus’s testing engine.</li>
        <li>UI-level or highly niche Spring testing scenarios.</li>

    - title: "Panache.Next"
      board-url: "https://github.com/orgs/quarkusio/projects/50"
      short-description: |
        The primary objective of this working group is to develop the next version of Panache.
      readme: |
        <h1>Objective</h1>
        <p>The main objective of this working group is to bring forth the next version of Panache.</p>
        <h1>The Problem</h1>
        <p>Panache is great for many things, but over time, we realised the following limitations:</p>
        <ul>
        <li>We have three distinct versions: Hibernate ORM, Hibernate Reactive and Mongo (blocking and reactive)</li>
        <li>It is impossible to use the same entities with Hibernate ORM and Hibernate Reactive</li>
        <li>Stateless sessions are not supported</li>
        <li>Hibernate Processor annotations, and Jakarta Data are not supported</li>
        <li>We have triplicate types such as <code>Sort</code> and <code>Order</code> between Panache, ORM and Jakarta Data</li>
        <li>We have two ways to place entity query operations : on the entity itself, or in repositories</li>
        <li>Entity query operations require type-system hacks which makes them less type-safe than we want with <code>var</code> and <code>for-each</code> and especially with reactive operations.</li>
        </ul>
        <h1>The proposed Solution</h1>
        <p>We propose a new Panache version that will solve all these issues:</p>
        <ul>
        <li>Unify all variants in a single module, supporting blocking, reactive, stateless and stateful sessions</li>
        <li>Provide an entity toplevel class for each 4 modes of operation, yet allow access to the other modes</li>
        <li>Move all entity query operations from the entity class to the repository class</li>
        <li>Provide a repository toplevel class for each 4 modes of operation, yet allow access to the other modes</li>
        <li>Provide easy access to any type of repository by placing them as nested interfaces in the entity class, via a generated accessor on the entity metamodel class</li>
        <li>Provide out of the box accessors for the 4 modes of operation repositories on the entity metamodel class</li>
        <li>Support Jakarta Data and Hibernate Processor type-safe annotations</li>
        <li>Optional: Support of Mongo via the coming ORM JDBC support</li>
        <li>Optional: provide JD repository type alternatives for the missing three modes</li>
        <li>Optional: provide a way to convert Panache 1 to Panache.Next</li>
        </ul>
        <h1>Definition of Done</h1>
        <ul>
        <li>Deliver the new Panache extension as a <code>stable</code> state (after preview/experimental versions for feedback)</li>
        <li>Tests</li>
        <li>Documentation</li>
        <li>Codestart</li>
        <li>REST Data with Panache support</li>
        <li>Renarde support</li>
        <li>Quarkus Insights</li>
        </ul>
        <h1>Scope of Work</h1>
        <p>It is currently out of scope to retrofit this with the existing Panache modules. This will be a new module with no backward compatibility (although most type-unsafe operations will continue as-is, so you will be familiar with them).</p>
        <h1>Organizing the Work</h1>
        <h2>Communication and Transparency:</h2>
        <p>This will be done via GitHub issues on the Quarkus core project.</p>
        <h2>Expected Timeline:</h2>
        <p>Most of the R&amp;D and design work has been completed over the last two years. Now remains the task of merging, documenting, testing, and tweaking it until it's complete.</p>

      short-description: |
        The Quarkus 4 working group aims to coordinate and track all Quarkus 4-related development in a long-running effort.
      readme: |
        <h2>Objective</h2>
        <p>This long‑running working group is dedicated to tracking development and ensuring a smooth rollout for Quarkus 4. It will serve as the central coordination point for feature tracking, release hygiene, migration guidance, and community alignment related to Quarkus 4.</p>
        <h2>The Problem</h2>
        <p>Quarkus 4 introduces significant shifts, including new Java 25 flags, architectural refinements, deprecations, and ecosystem changes. Without a focused group, efforts become fragmented, and downstream consumers (extensions, integrations, platform partners) may struggle to stay aligned.</p>
        <h2>Proposed Solution</h2>
        <p>Establish a designated WG to:</p>
        <ul>
        <li>Track all Quarkus 4‑related issues and PRs (using label triage/quarkus-4)</li>
        <li>Maintain a GitHub project board for feature status, blockers, and timelines</li>
        <li>Coordinate across teams (core, extensions, platform, tooling)</li>
        <li>Surface migration considerations and flag impacts (e.g. new --add-opens needs, optimized defaults) - useful to create the migration guide and rules</li>
        <li>Publish ADRs, migration guides, and summary docs</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Definition of Done</h2>
        <p>This WG will be considered complete when:</p>
        <ul>
        <li>Quarkus 4 GA is released (including the platform)</li>

    - title: "Dev Services Lifecycle"
      board-url: "https://github.com/orgs/quarkusio/projects/49"
      short-description: |
        This working group will define and implement a consistent and configurable lifecycle model for Dev Services. It will shift the startup to the correct phase, enable optional reuse across dev and test modes, and clarify teardown and sharing behavior. The goal is to improve the developer experience.
      readme: |
        <p>This working group was formed to address long-standing inconsistencies and pain points in the Dev Services lifecycle within Quarkus. Dev Services are essential for simplifying local development and testing by automatically provisioning runtime dependencies (e.g., databases, message brokers), but their current lifecycle behavior leads to confusion and inefficiencies. Most notably, they are started during the augmentation phase, which conflicts with their inherently runtime-oriented nature and causes issues with newer efforts such as the test classloading revamp.</p>
        <p>The primary goal of this group is to define and implement a consistent, runtime-aligned lifecycle model for Dev Services. This includes shifting their startup to a phase after augmentation but before the application begins execution, ensuring better alignment with the runtime environment. A critical focus will also be on enabling optional reuse of Dev Services across dev and test modes — including reuse between repeated test executions — to reduce startup time and improve the iterative development experience.</p>
        <p>The group's scope covers several strategic areas: formalizing when and how Dev Services are started, reused, or stopped; defining rules for discoverability and sharing between profiles or processes; and avoiding resource leaks or accidental retention. It explicitly excludes broader orchestration features (such as service dependency graphs) and unrelated feature enhancements.</p>
        <p>The working group will produce a set of deliverables to support the new model. These include one or more Architecture Decision Records (ADRs) describing the new lifecycle model, the implementation of lifecycle logic in Quarkus Core, and updates to both user-facing and contributor documentation. Additionally, enhancements to the Dev Services development model will make it easier for extension authors to adopt and follow the new lifecycle standards. A public communication effort (e.g., blog posts or demos) will also be used to showcase the improvements.</p>

        In the past month, the WG - Dev Services Lifecycle made significant progress by closing essential issues related to the new dev services model. The team successfully transitioned AWS Lambda to the updated model, initiated services after augmentation, and added a runtime module for quarkus-devservices. However, a new issue was opened concerning the unintended startup of Keycloak dev services during the augmentation phase, along with another issue related to the QuarkusTestProfileAwareClassOrderer, indicating continued work needed to enhance the developer experience.

    - title: "Unified Saga implementation"
      board-url: "https://github.com/orgs/quarkusio/projects/48"
      short-description: |
        The main objective of this working group is to unify Quarkus's story about Saga-based transactions.
      readme: |
        <h3>Objective:</h3>
        <p>The main objective of this working group is to unify Quarkus's story about Saga-based transactions.</p>
        <h3>The Problem</h3>
        <p>The primary saga solution for distributed transactions is <a href="https://github.com/quarkusio/quarkus/tree/main/extensions/narayana-lra">narayana-lra</a> extension. However, it wasn't maintained and marketed as the number one solution for distributed sagas. So we either need to update LRA to make a unified solution for Quarkus or pick a different solution that was introduced in the meantime. This WG will unify Quarkus's story in a distributed transaction solution.</p>
        <h3>The proposed Solution</h3>
        <p>We will investigate and compare available solutions for the saga-based implementation of the distributed tx processing. This will be documented, and the choice should be proven to be able to drive development and innovation in this area. We will ensure the solution meets the Quarkus standards (build/runtime split, dev service, dev ui).</p>
        <h3>Definition of Done</h3>
        <ul>
        <li>A new guide for the distributed tx (or the chosen solution if there is only one)</li>
        <li>Blog post comparing available solutions or just marketing the chosen solution</li>
        <li>Quarkus insights about this topic</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Scope of Work</h3>
        <p>The scope of this WG is to pick a chosen saga-based implementation and make it Quarkus native (dev mode, any possible enhancements). We will choose implementation with an already available Quarkus integration. Research of new saga-based alternatives is out of scope.</p>
        <h3>Organizing the Work</h3>
        <p>Communication and Transparency:</p>
        <p>Coordination will be done in this GitHub discussion and the individual GitHub issues. GitHub issues can be closed if the saga-solution is not to be updated anymore. The decision of the chosen solution will be stated also as the resolution of https://github.com/quarkusio/quarkus/issues/34181.</p>
        <p>This work can take place in either Quarkus core (narayana-lra) or some new extension that will be provided in Quarkiverse.</p>
        <h3>Expected Timeline:</h3>
        <p>Milestone 1 - Document in this discussion saga-based implementations alternatives
        Milestone 2 - Pick one solution that will be Quarkus Saga solution
        Milestone 3 - Update the chosen alternative for Quarkus standards (simplification of use, dev * features)
        Milestone 4 - Create a guide to document it
        Milestone 5 - Blog + Quarkus insights</p>

        Allow Static Site Generation with Quarkus.
      readme: |
        <p>New initiative to allow Static Site Generation with Quarkus.</p>
        <p>Quarkus already provides most of the pieces to create great web applications (https://quarkus.io/guides/web).</p>
        <p>I recently added https://github.com/quarkiverse/quarkus-roq. It will allow generating a static website out of any Quarkus application (it starts the app, fetch all the configured pages and assets, generate a static website and stop), it already works but it is still very alpha.</p>
        <p>What's missing? we now need to incrementally add the toolkit to ease the process of creating static content through Quarkus:</p>
        <ul>
        <li>Static Data</li>
        <li>Markdown/Asciidoc and frontmatter</li>
        <li>SEO</li>
        <li>Image processing</li>
        <li>Easy to configure routing</li>
        </ul>
        <p>This will allow to develop the content using Quarkus dev-mode, and then generate for Github Pages or similar when it's ready.</p>
        <p>Bonus, everything added will benefit any &quot;non-static&quot; Quarkus app and any Static Quarkus app could also become non static.</p>
        <p>This effort is now tracked using a &quot;Working Group&quot; project: https://github.com/orgs/quarkiverse/projects/6</p>
        <p>This is a great opportunity to participate in fun effort and be involved with the Quarkus community, if anyone is interested in being a part of this, please reach out to me 🚀</p>

      short-description: |
        Track the progress around the new TLS configuration centralization and new features (like Let's Encrypt, Cert-Manager, and local experience...)
      readme: |
        <p>TLS is becoming increasingly common and recommended. However, for years, each Quarkus extension has been doing its own TLS configuration and management. As a result, the configuration looks different everywhere, and many extensions have incomplete configurations.</p>
        <p>Based on the newly integrated TLS registry, we now have a single place to configure TLS. At runtime, it provides methods to configure Vert.x and &quot;pure&quot; Java clients (using an <code>SSLContext</code>).</p>
        <p>The goal of this focus group is to continue integrating the TLS registry and improve Quarkus integration with certificate providers (Let's Encrypt, Cert-Manager). In addition, we would like to provide a frictionless local experience around TLS (i.e., without the infamous untrusted certificate screen).</p>

      short-description: |
        A working group focusing on the generation of Dockerfile / ContainerFile
      readme: |
        <p>At the moment, when you create a Quarkus project (from code.quarkus.io or the CLI), a set of <code>Dockerfiles</code> is generated. However,</p>
        <ol>
        <li>Not all these files are used by the user</li>
        <li>These files are very quickly outdated</li>
        <li>It does not allow <em>extensions</em> to customize the content</li>
        </ol>
        <p>This working group aims to replace these `Dockerfiles' with a CLI command that generates an up-to-date Dockerfile and includes extension customization.</p>
        <p>The goal is not to allow updating these files once generated but to provide a one-off generation that the user can consult and use. It will use the recommended and up-to-date <code>FROM</code> image to improve security and, depending on the generated <em>variant</em> (JVM, native, native-micro...), follow good practices (such as using <code>run-java</code> for the JVM one).</p>
        <p>You can find more details about this working group on <a href="https://github.com/quarkusio/quarkus/discussions/41352">this discussion</a>.
        Once completed, this working group will be followed by other initiatives focusing on generating the Github Action and Tekton pipelines.</p>

:summary: Start the Narayana LRA coordinator automatically in dev and test modes.
:topics: data,lra,narayana
:extensions: io.quarkus:quarkus-narayana-lra

If the Narayana LRA extension is present (`quarkus-narayana-lra`), the Dev
Services for Narayana LRA coordinator automatically starts the Narayana LRA
coordinator in dev mode and when running tests. So, you don't have to start it
manually. The application is also configured automatically to connect to the
coordinator and to make possible for the coordinator to call back the
application.

WARNING: Because the LRA coordinator needs to call back your application from
the container, we need to expose the application on any host address, not just
`localhost`. So the Dev Services for LRA coordinator injects
`quarkus.http.host=0.0.0.0` into your application configuration which means that
your application is accessible from any machine running in the same network as
your development machine. *This is a potential security risk*, so use the LRA
Dev Services only if you are sure that it is safe.

== Enabling / Disabling Dev Services for LRA

Dev Services for LRA is automatically enabled unless:

- `quarkus.lra.devservices.enabled` is set to `false`
- the `quarkus.lra.coordinator-url` is configured

Dev Services for LRA relies on Docker or Podman to start the coordinator. If
your environment does not support Docker, you will need to start the coordinator
manually, or connect to an already running coordinator. You can configure the
coordinator URL using `quarkus.lra.coordinator-url`.

== Sharing LRA coordinator

Most likely you need to share the LRA coordinator between applications. The Dev
Services for LRA coordinator implements a _service discovery_ mechanism for your
multiple Quarkus applications running in _dev_ mode to share a single
coordinator.

NOTE: Dev Services for LRA starts the container with the
`quarkus-dev-service-lra-coordinator` label which is used to identify the
container.

If you need multiple (shared) coordinators, you can configure the
`quarkus.lra.devservices.service-name` attribute and indicate the coordinator
name. It looks for a container with the same value, or starts a new one if none
can be found. The default service name is `lra-coordinator`.

Sharing is enabled by default in dev mode, but disabled in test mode.
You can disable the sharing with `quarkus.lra.devservices.shared=false`.

== Setting the port

By default, Dev Services for LRA picks a random port on which to run the LRA
coordinator. You can set the port by configuring the
`quarkus.lra.devservices.port` property. The connection property
`quarkus.lra.coordinator-url` is automatically configured with the chosen port.

[[configuring-the-image]]
== Configuring the image

The default image for the LRA coordinator is `quay.io/jbosstm/lra-coordinator`.
You can configure the image used by Dev Services for LRA coordinator using the
`quarkus.lra.devservices.image-name` property. You can browse the available
images at https://quay.io/repository/jbosstm/lra-coordinator?tab=tags.

[[Compose]]
== Compose

The LRA Dev Services supports xref:compose-dev-services.adoc[Compose Dev Services].
It relies on a `compose-devservices.yml`, such as:

[source,yaml]
----
name: <application name>
services:
  mongo:
    image: quay.io/jbosstm/lra-coordinator:7.2.2.Final-3.24.4
    ports:
      - "8080"
----

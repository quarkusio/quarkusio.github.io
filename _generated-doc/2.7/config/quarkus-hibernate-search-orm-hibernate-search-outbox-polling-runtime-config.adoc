By default, sharding is dynamic and setting this property is not necessary.

If you want to control explicitly the number and assignment of shards,

Shards are referred to by an index in the range [0, total_count - 1] (see `shards.total-count`).
A given application node must be assigned at least one shard but may be assigned multiple shards

How long the event processor can poll for events before it must perform a "pulse",
updating and checking registrations in the agents table.

The pulse interval must be set to a value between the polling interval
and one third (1/3) of the expiration interval.

Low values (closer to the polling interval) mean less time wasted not processing events

and reduced risk of wasting time not processing events
because an event processor is incorrectly considered disconnected,
but more stress on the database because of more frequent checks of the list of agents.

How long an event processor "pulse" remains valid before considering the processor disconnected

The expiration interval must be set to a value at least 3 times larger than the pulse interval.

Low values (closer to the pulse interval) mean less time wasted not processing events

The timeout for transactions processing outbox events.

When this property is not set,

How long an event processor "pulse" remains valid before considering the processor disconnected
and forcibly removing it from the cluster.

The expiration interval must be set to a value at least 3 times larger than the pulse interval.

Low values (closer to the pulse interval) mean less time wasted with event processors not processing events
when a mass indexer agent terminates due to a crash,
but increased risk of event processors starting to process events again during mass indexing
because a mass indexer agent is incorrectly considered disconnected.

High values (much larger than the pulse interval) mean more time wasted with event processors not processing events
when a mass indexer agent terminates due to a crash,
but reduced risk of event processors starting to process events again during mass indexing
because a mass indexer agent is incorrectly considered disconnected.

that event processors finally suspended themselves,
but will increase the stress on the database while the mass indexer agent is actively waiting.

High values will increase the time it takes for the mass indexer agent to detect
that event processors finally suspended themselves,
but will reduce the stress on the database while the mass indexer agent is actively waiting.

[.description]
--
How long the mass indexer can wait before it must perform a "pulse",
updating and checking registrations in the agent table.

The pulse interval must be set to a value between the polling interval
and one third (1/3) of the expiration interval.

Low values (closer to the polling interval) mean reduced risk of
event processors starting to process events again during mass indexing
because a mass indexer agent is incorrectly considered disconnected,
but more stress on the database because of more frequent updates of the mass indexer agent's entry in the agent table.

High values (closer to the expiration interval) mean increased risk of
event processors starting to process events again during mass indexing
because a mass indexer agent is incorrectly considered disconnected,
but less stress on the database because of less frequent updates of the mass indexer agent's entry in the agent table.

[.description]
--
How long an event processor "pulse" remains valid before considering the processor disconnected
and forcibly removing it from the cluster.

The expiration interval must be set to a value at least 3 times larger than the pulse interval.

Low values (closer to the pulse interval) mean less time wasted with event processors not processing events
when a mass indexer agent terminates due to a crash,
but increased risk of event processors starting to process events again during mass indexing
because a mass indexer agent is incorrectly considered disconnected.

High values (much larger than the pulse interval) mean more time wasted with event processors not processing events
when a mass indexer agent terminates due to a crash,
but reduced risk of event processors starting to process events again during mass indexing
because a mass indexer agent is incorrectly considered disconnected.

.About the Duration format
====
The format for durations uses the standard `java.time.Duration` format.
You can learn more about it in the link:https://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/api/java/time/Duration.html#parse-java.lang.CharSequence-[Duration#parse() javadoc].

You can also provide duration values starting with a number.
In this case, if the value consists only of a number, the converter treats the value as seconds.
Otherwise, `PT` is implicitly prepended to the value to obtain a standard `java.time.Duration` format.

[.description]
--
Whether Quarkus should wait between shutdown being requested and actually initiated. This delay gives the infrastructure time to detect that the application instance is shutting down and stop routing traffic to it.

[.description]
--
The timeout to wait for running requests to finish. If this is not set then the application will exit immediately. Setting this timeout will incur a small performance penalty, as it requires active requests to be tracked.

a| [[quarkus-core_quarkus-shutdown-delay]] [.property-path]##`quarkus.shutdown.delay`##

[.description]
--
Delay between shutdown being requested and actually initiated. Also called the pre-shutdown phase. In pre-shutdown, the server continues working as usual, except a readiness probe starts reporting "down" (if the `smallrye-health` extension is present). This gives the infrastructure time to detect that the application instance is shutting down and stop routing traffic to it. Notice that this property will only take effect if `quarkus.shutdown.delay-enabled` is explicitly set to `true`.

.About the Duration format
====
To write duration values, use the standard `java.time.Duration` format.
See the link:https://docs.oracle.com/en/java/javase/17/docs/api/java.base/java/time/Duration.html#parse(java.lang.CharSequence)[Duration#parse() Java API documentation] for more information.

You can also use a simplified format, starting with a number:

* If the value is only a number, it represents time in seconds.
* If the value is a number followed by `ms`, it represents time in milliseconds.

In other cases, the simplified format is translated to the `java.time.Duration` format for parsing:

* If the value is a number followed by `h`, `m`, or `s`, it is prefixed with `PT`.
* If the value is a number followed by `d`, it is prefixed with `P`.

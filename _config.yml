# Welcome to Jekyll!
#
# This config file is meant for settings that affect your whole blog, values
# which you are expected to set up once and rarely edit after that. If you find
# yourself editing this file very often, consider using Jekyll's data files
# feature for the data you need to update frequently.
#
# For technical reasons, this file is *NOT* reloaded automatically when you use
# 'bundle exec jekyll serve'. If you change this file, please restart the server process.

# Site settings
# These are used to personalize your new site. If you look in the HTML files,
# you will see them accessed via {{ site.title }}, {{ site.email }}, and so on.
# You can create any custom variable you would like, and they will be accessible
# in the templates via {{ site.myvariable }}.

  # The amount of time before we give up on a pending remote search and fall back to Javascript search.
  # The search service itself is reasonably fast on a decent machine (with curl: ~100ms median, ~150ms 90th percentile).
  # but it's slower on prod machines (with curl: ~200ms median, ~400ms 90th percentile),
  # and prod network overhead makes it even worse (with curl from France: ~750ms median, ~1000ms 90th percentile),
  # so we need a high timeout with some margin for varying network latency depending on browser location.
  # Such a high timeout is acceptable since Javascript search is almost instantaneous,
  # so when we hit the timeout the user won't experience much more delay.

  initial-timeout: 1500
  # When fetching more pages, a timeout would be very bad for UX
  # since we would reset the whole page using Javascript --
  # while the user is reading through it!
  # This we set a higher timeout value, to make timeouts less likely.

  # Optional the title format for the paginated pages (supports :title for original page title, :num for pagination page number, :max for total number of pages)
  title: ':title - page :num'

  # Limit how many pagenated pages to create (default: 0, means all)

  # Optional, the default locale to use, omit to disable (depends on a field 'locale' to be specified in the posts,
  # in reality this can be any value, suggested are the Microsoft locale-codes (e.g. en_US, en_GB) or simply the ISO-639 language code )

 # Optional,omit or set both before and after to zero to disable.
 # Controls how the pagination trail for the paginated pages look like.

  # Optional, the default name of the index file for generated pages (e.g. 'index.html')
  # Without file extension

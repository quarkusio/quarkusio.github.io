In May, we were alerted about a potential leak in the https://smallrye.io/[SmallRye] release process.
We acted swiftly to mitigate the issue; fortunately, no damage was done.
Even if Quarkiverse has no reported leak, during our investigation, we uncovered a deeper flaw that affected not only SmallRye but also Quarkiverse.

In this blog post, we’ll explain the vulnerability we discovered and introduce a more secure release pipeline for both Quarkiverse and SmallRye repositories.

**TL;DR:** We’ve uncovered a security flaw in the release process for Quarkiverse and SmallRye that could have allowed malicious actors to impersonate projects and publish compromised artifacts.
We’ve implemented a new, more secure release pipeline to address this.
If you’re a maintainer, you’ve received a pull request to migrate to the new process.
Quarkus itself is not affected by this issue, only SmallRye and Quarkiverse.

Please act immediately, as the old release process will be retired by October 16th, 2024.
So make sure to merge the pull request before then to avoid any disruptions in your releases.
If you have any questions or concerns, please contact us on https://quarkusio.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/187038-dev[Zulip] or https://github.com/quarkusio/quarkus/discussions[GitHub Discussions].
Details on this change are <<Call for action: Migrating to the new release process, below>>.

For more details on the issue, the solution, and how to adapt, read on!

==  The Flaw: A Closer Look at the Release Process

To understand the flaw, it’s important to outline the release process Quarkiverse and SmallRye used first.
Quarkiverse and SmallRye offer development facilities to ease the development of Quarkus extensions and SmallRye projects used in Quarkus, respectively.
There is no central supervision of all these repositories; they evolve at their own pace, individually.

Both organizations use GitHub repositories and GitHub Actions as CI and automation framework.
Here’s how the release project worked:

1. A developer opens a pull request in the repository, updating the version number in the project’s `project.yaml` file (See https://github.com/quarkiverse/quarkus-langchain4j/pull/904[this PR] as an example).
2. The regular build workflow runs to ensure it builds successfully.
A specific pre-release flow also runs to verify that the YAML file is correctly formatted.
3. Once the pull request is merged, a release workflow is triggered.
4. The release workflow starts by _preparing_ the release.
It sets the project's version to the configured version and creates a tag with the new updated code.
It also updates the main branch (or the source branch of the pull request) to the next development version and commits this change to the branch.
5. Once the preparation step is complete, the tag is checked out, and the release artifacts are created.
This phase is called _release perform_.
During that phase, binary artifacts are created from the tagged sources.
The artifacts are signed and pushed to Maven Central.

The last step, the _release perform_, is where the flaw exists. Here’s why:

* To sign the artifacts, the workflow uses an organization-wide GPG key
* To publish the artifacts, the workflow uses organization-wide credentials

image::flaw.png[The flaw in the release process,float="center",align="center"]

The GPG passphrase and the Maven Central credential are stored as secrets in the project’s GitHub repository but shared across the entire organization.
They are not freely accessible.
You cannot print them in the log (without a bit of magic), and cannot be accessed from forks.

At this point, everything seems fine.
Both SmallRye and Quarkiverse provide maintainers with great freedom to customize GitHub Action workflows to fit their needs.
This flexibility, while empowering, also introduces risks.
And ... here we go....

== The Problem: A Risk of Credential Exposure (and Impersonification)

We said that secrets are not freely accessible.
That’s true, except for one case.
GitHub Actions (see Github Action Security overview) running in the project itself can access them.
Even tests can access them.
Anything running during the workflow (actions, scripts...) can access these secrets... and leak them.

When a developer includes an external or third-party GitHub Action, Maven / Gradle plugin, or Junit Extension...  in their workflow, that code gains access to the organization-wide credentials.
Any code running during the workflow on the repository — not a fork — can potentially expose these secrets.
The ramifications are severe:

* An attacker could release compromised yet legitimate-looking project versions signed with the organization’s GPG key to Maven Central.
* Worse still, they could push malicious artifacts to Maven Central under the Quarkiverse or SmallRye banner, impersonating the entire organization.

In short, with access to these credentials, an attacker could impersonate Quarkiverse or SmallRye, bypassing typical protections like signed commits or branch protection.
The vulnerability arises from the fact that these credentials are shared and available to any code running during the workflow.

Despite quickly mitigating the initial SmallRye leak, discovering this larger flaw prompted us to reevaluate our release process.
It became clear that we needed a more secure and resilient approach to prevent such risks in the future.

== The Solution: A new release process

After careful consideration, we concluded that relying on organization-wide secrets for releases was no longer viable.
We needed a more secure approach.

At first, we explored the idea of using repository-specific credentials.
While this would limit the blast radius in case of a leak, it would be difficult to manage at scale and slow down the onboarding process.
Additionally, an individual repository could still be compromised and impersonated even with this approach.
Therefore, we decided against this solution.

Instead, we devised a more robust and secure solution involving two repositories: one for the code being released and a separate one for executing the release perform phase itself.
Crucially, the repository with the source code no longer has access to organization-wide credentials—only the second repository does.

When the second workflow (red) is complete, it unblocks the first one (blue).
Thus, you know when the second workflow is completed and if it was successful.

=== How It Works: A Step-by-Step Breakdown

With this new approach, the initial stages of the release process remain unchanged.
Here’s what happens now:

1. A developer opens a pull request, updating the version number in the `project.yaml` file.
2. The pre-release workflow is triggered within the repository, ensuring the build is correct and the version is appropriately updated.
3. Once the pull request is merged, the release process diverges from the previous approach:

  * The first repository executes the preparation steps, such as version updates, tag creation, and setting the next development version.
  * The release artifacts are generated but not signed or pushed to Maven Central.

At this point, a second workflow is triggered in a separate repository.
This is where the critical actions happen:

* The second repository, which contains the necessary credentials (Maven Central credentials and GPG passphrase), downloads the release artifacts.
* It verifies the integrity of the artifacts using attestations.
* The artifacts are then signed and pushed to Maven Central.

This second repository is crucial for security.
It’s locked down and non-modifiable, meaning no developer can customize the workflow or inadvertently introduce a vulnerability.
By isolating the sensitive release steps in this secured environment, we’ve significantly reduced the risk of leaks or unauthorized access.

This new process provides a much-needed layer of separation, ensuring that the credentials remain protected and that the possibility of a leak is greatly diminished.

=== Balancing Security with Developer Freedom

As highlighted earlier, both Quarkiverse and SmallRye strongly emphasize empowering developers by minimizing the overhead of maintaining open-source components.
Our new release process maintains this philosophy, ensuring developers still have the flexibility to adjust workflows in their component repositories as needed.

Developers and maintainers can continue to modify workflows, introduce custom CI steps, and tailor their processes to meet specific project needs.
The only significant change is that part of the release process—the critical signing and publishing steps—now occurs in a separate, secured repository.

Importantly, maintainers retain the ability to trigger a release at any time, from any branch, just as they could before.
The handoff to the second repository happens seamlessly, so the developer experience remains largely the same.

This flexibility remains intact for projects that have heavily customized their release pipelines (for example, incorporating pre-release validations or automating tasks like website updates, release note generation, or breaking change detection).
These projects can still trigger:

* Validation workflows when the `project.yaml` file is updated via a pull request.
* Post-release workflows, triggered when a new tag is created, allow tasks such as documentation updates or notifications to continue unhindered.

By preserving this level of freedom, we ensure that developers can adapt their workflows to the needs of their projects while benefiting from a more secure release pipeline.

=== Resilience: Preparing for the Unexpected


The release process, by its nature, is a complex and multi-step operation where things can occasionally go wrong.
While the new release pipeline adds another layer of complexity due to its split-repository design, we have built resilience into the system to mitigate potential issues.

To address this, we’ve ensured that the new process is idempotent, meaning it can be safely retried without causing inconsistencies or errors.
If a failure occurs at any point during the release — whether due to network issues, build failures, or artifact verification problems — the process can be restarted from the failed workflow.
This allows the release to proceed without needing to repeat previous steps unnecessarily.

Additionally, we have built in various checks and verifications at key stages of the release process, such as verifying artifact integrity (using attestation) are completed before moving on to the next stage.
These safeguards help reduce the risk of an incomplete or erroneous release.

Should any unexpected issues arise, both the component repository and the secured release repository provide detailed logs, allowing developers to diagnose and resolve problems quickly.
This transparency ensures that maintainers remain in control, even when things don’t go as planned.

These measures aim to provide a more resilient, fault-tolerant release process that doesn’t compromise on security or developer experience.

== Call for action: Migrating to the new release process

If you are a Quarkiverse or SmallRye project maintainer, you’ve received a pull request that updates your project to the new, more secure release process.
For most maintainers, this update will be seamless and require no other changes.

However, as mentioned earlier, if your project uses a customized or more sophisticated release pipeline, you may need to make a few adjustments to ensure compatibility with the new system.
This could involve updating custom workflows that handle pre-validation steps, website publishing, or release note generation.
Please take the time to review and test the changes in your repository to ensure everything works as expected.

== Important Timeline: Deprecation of the Old Release Process

The previous release process has now been deprecated and will be fully blocked by October 16th, 2024.
After this date, releasing your project using the old pipeline will no longer be possible.
Thus, you must adopt the new release process pull request before this deadline to avoid disrupting your project’s release cycle.

For maintainers with more complex setups, we encourage you to start the migration as soon as possible to ensure a smooth transition.
Roberto Cortez, George Gastaldi, and the rest of the Quarkus and SmallRye teams are here to help if you need assistance.

__Next Steps:__

* Review the Pull Request: Check the automated pull request in your repository and verify that it updates your release process to the new system.
* Merge the Changes: Merge the changes before the deprecation date to avoid release interruptions.
* Test Your Workflow: If you’ve customized your release process, run tests to ensure everything still functions as expected under the new pipeline.
* Reach Out for Support: If you have any questions or need help with the migration, please contact us on https://quarkusio.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/187038-dev[Zulip] or https://github.com/quarkusio/quarkus/discussions[GitHub Discussions].

This new release process is a vital step in improving the security of Quarkiverse and SmallRye, and your swift action in migrating will help us ensure the integrity of these projects moving forward.

== Summary: Nothing Changes for You — It’s Just More Secure

From a Smallrye and Quarkiverse developer’s perspective, the release process for Quarkiverse and SmallRye remains essentially the same.
You still have the freedom to modify workflows, customize release steps, and trigger releases as needed.
The flexibility and control you’ve come to rely on haven’t changed.

The main difference is behind the scenes: a separate, secured repository now handles the critical steps of signing and publishing your release.
This means the process is more robust, with sensitive credentials locked down, and the risk of leaks or impersonation significantly reduced.

In short, while we’ve enhanced the security of the release pipeline, we’ve done so in a way that minimizes disruption.
You’ll still enjoy the same developer experience — only now, with the added peace of mind that your releases are more secure than ever.

== A Special Thank You

Redefining a more secure and reliable release process was no small feat, and it certainly wasn’t something we could accomplish without some dedicated and enthusiastic developers.
I’d like to extend our heartfelt thanks to George Gastaldi and Roberto Cortez for carrying out much of the heavy lifting throughout this process.
Your dedication and expertise were invaluable.

I’d also like to give a special shoutout to Andres Almiray, whose support with JReleaser was absolutely instrumental.
The new release process simply wouldn’t have been possible without his reactivity and guidance.

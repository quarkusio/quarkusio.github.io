We were approached for comment about the relative performance of Quarkus for a reactive CRUD workload.  This is a good case study into performance test design and some of the considerations required and hurdles that need to be overcome. What methodology can we derive for ensuring that the test we are performing is indeed the test that we are expecting?


== "Why is Quarkus 600x times slower than `{INSERT_FRAMEWORK_HERE}`?!?"

A recent report of bad result from Quarkus warranted some further investigation. On the face of it the results looked bad, really bad, for Quarkus.

=== tl;dr

By correcting implementation errors in a benchmark test, and carefully designing the test environment to ensure that only the application is being stressed, Quarkus goes from handling *1.75 req/sec* to nearly *26,000 req/sec*. Each request queried and wrote to a MySQL database, using the same load driver and hardware.

== Test architecture

The test that was shared with us is a simple load test that updates a database via REST invocations;

image::reactiveBenchmark.png[]

. A load generator creates a continuous stream of HTTP POST requests to a REST api. In this case https://github.com/wg/wrk[wrk]
. A Quarkus application process the request via https://quarkus.io/guides/resteasy-reactive[RESTEasy Reactive]
. The Quarkus application queries and updates a MySQL database instance via https://hibernate.org/reactive/[Hibernate Reactive]

The source code for the test can be found here: https://github.com/thiagohora/tutorials/tree/fix_jmeter_test

== Initial Results image:emoji-unhappy.png[Unhappy, 35, 35]


Initial results for Quarkus were not promising;

That was 105 requests in 60 seconds, with 10 errors. Only 95 requests had been successfully sent in 60 seconds, or *1.75 req/sec*

Running the comparison test on my machine;

Overall, the request rate that Quarkus could support was only *1.75 req/sec!!* Ok, so it wasn't *600* times slower, but it was *192* times slower on my machine.

but... something was not correct, Quarkus was displaying the following exception in the service logs;

```

An initial investigation showed that the number of open MySQL connections during the test was very high: **96 open connections**

```
mysql> show status like '%onn%';

+-----------------------------------------------+---------------------+
16 rows in set (0.01 sec)
```

And checking the number of inserts the application had managed to perform within 1minutes;

```
mysql> select count(*) from ZipCode;
+----------+
| count(*) |
+----------+
|       95 |
+----------+
1 row in set (0.00 sec)

```

There was obviously something wrong with the database connections! Each connection was committing only a single value to the database and no more progress was being made. The number of entries in the database tallied _exactly_ with the number of successful HTTP requests.

Reviewing the CPU time for the Quarkus process confirmed that no further work was being done after the initial 95 commits to the database, the application was deadlocked;

*Is the application behaving as expected?*

If the application is erroring, the results are not valid. Before continuing, investigate *why* the errors are occurring and fix the application.

== Initial inspection of code

A quick review of the code revealed the deadlocking issue;

[source,java]
----
@POST
@Transactional
public Uni<ZipCode> create(ZipCode zipCode) {
    return getById(zipCode.getZip())
        .onItem()
        .ifNull()
        .switchTo(createZipCode(zipCode))
        .onFailure(PersistenceException.class)
        .recoverWithUni(() -> getById(zipCode.getZip()));
}
----

Ah Ha! the endpoint is annotated with `@Transactional`. The application is using Hibernate Reactive, so instead we need to use the  `@ReactiveTransactional` annotation. For further details, please read the https://quarkus.io/guides/hibernate-reactive-panache#transactions[Simplified Hibernate Reactive with Panache] guide. This can be confusing, but conversations have started about how to clarify the different requirements and warn users if there is an issue.

public Uni<ZipCode> create(ZipCode zipCode) {
    return getById(zipCode.getZip())
        .onItem()

        .switchTo(createZipCode(zipCode))
        .onFailure(PersistenceException.class)
        .recoverWithUni(() -> getById(zipCode.getZip()));
}

Let's try again:

----


**390.21 req/sec!!** that's much better!!

With the test fixed, we can see a lot more data in the database table;

[source,bash]
----
mysql> select count(*) from ZipCode;
+----------+
| count(*) |
+----------+
|    10362 |
+----------+
1 row in set (0.00 sec)
----

NOTE: The test has been designed to query the database if a ZipCode already exists, before attempting to insert a new ZipCode. There are a finite number of ZipCodes, so as the test progresses, the number of ZipCode entries will tend towards the maximum number of ZipCodes. The workload progresses from being write heavy to read heavy.


== Same results image:emoji-unhappy.png[Unhappy, 35, 35]

but... my hard disk on my machine was making a **lot** of noise during the test! The Quarkus result of *390.21 req/sec* is suspiciously similar to the comparison baseline of *336.86 req/sec*, and...

If a *system component* is the performance bottleneck (i.e. not the application under test), we are not actually stress testing the application.

We still have a bottleneck outside of the application, most likely within MySQL or we are still I/O bound!

At this point, we have a couple of options, we can either;

 A) tune MySQL/IO so that they are no longer the bottleneck

or

 B) constrain that application below the maximum, such that the rest of the system is operating within its limits

The easiest option is to simply constrain the application.  

[IMPORTANT]
====
*Choose your scaling methodology*

We can either scale up or tune the system, or we can scale down the application to below the limits of the system.

Choosing to scale up the system, or constrain the application, is a decision dependent on the goals of the testing.

====


== Constrain application image:emoji-happy.png[Happy, 35, 35]

We will remove the MySQL/System bottleneck by constraining the application to 4 CPU cores, therefore reducing the maximum load the application can drive to the database. We achieve this by running the application in docker;

Ok, so we are not at Max Throughput, but we *have* removed the system outside of the application as a bottleneck. *The bottleneck is NOW the application*

[IMPORTANT]
====
*Create an environment where the comparisons are valid* 

By constraining the application, we are not running at absolute Max Throughput possible, _but_ we have created an environment that allows for comparisons between frameworks.

With a constrained application environment, we will not be in the situation where one or more frameworks are sustaining throughput levels that are at the limit of the system.  

If any application _is_ at the system limit, the results are invalid.

This provided us with a final, comparable throughput result of *14,955.61 req/sec*

== Results image:emoji-happy.png[Happy, 35, 35]

Is Quarkus really 600x times slower than Framework X/Y/Z? *Of course not!*

On my machine;

. the initial result was *1.75 req/sec*.  
. fixing the application brought that up to *390.21 req/sec*
. fixing some of the system bottlenecks gave us **25,599.85 req/sec**
. constraining the application, so that a fairer comparison with other frameworks can be made resulted in *18,667.87 req/sec*
. and finally, enabling TLS encryption to the database gives a final result of *14,955.61 req/sec*

IMPORTANT: Run *5* gives us our baseline for comparison, *14,955.61 req/sec*


=== Where does that leave Quarkus compared to Framework X/Y/Z?

well... that is an exercise for the reader ;-)


== Summary


Do these results show that Quarkus is quick? Well kinda, they hint at it, but there are still issues with the methodology that need resolving.

However, when faced with a benchmark result, especially one that does not appear to make sense, there are a number of steps you can take to validate the result;

 - *Fix the application*: Are there errors? Is the test functioning as expected? If there are errors, resolve them
 - *Ensure the application is the bottleneck*: What are the limiting factors for the test? Is the test CPU, Network I/O, Disk I/O bound? 
 - *Do not stop evaluating the test when you see a _"good"_ result*. For comparisons, you need to ensure that _every_ framework is the limiting factor for performance and not the system.
 - *Chose how to constrain the application*: either by scaling up the system, or scaling down the application.
 - *Validate that all frameworks are doing the same work*. For comparisons, are the frameworks performing the same work? 
 - *Ensure al frameworks are providing the same level of security*. Are the semantics the same?  e.g. same TLS encoding? same db transaction isolation levels? 

IMPORTANT: The System Under Test includes the *System*. Do not automatically _assume_ that your application is the bottleneck

== Notes on Methodology

[CAUTION]
====
*Does this benchmark tell us everything we need to know about how Quarkus behaves under load? Not really! It gives us _one_ data point*

In order to have a meaningful understanding of behavior under load, the following issues with methodology need to be addressed;

- Load generation, database and application are all running on a single machine. The current test does not stress any of the network stack and there are side effects due to co-location of services. The application topology needs to be representative of a production environment.
- This test does not measure application responsiveness from a _users perspective_. A tool that does not suffer from http://highscalability.com/blog/2015/10/5/your-load-generator-is-probably-lying-to-you-take-the-red-pi.html[coordinated omissions], such as https://hyperfoil.io/[Hyperfoil], is required to accurately measure service response time, including system wait time. *throughput != response time* and response time is what matters to users!
- The mixture of read/writes to the database changes throughout the duration of the test. Initially the load is very write heavy, as time progresses, the database load is predominantly read heavy. A more consistent pattern of read/writes should be maintained throughout the test duration.
- The applications are not given time to correctly "warm up", therefore the results are a mixture of Java code running in interpreted mode and compiled mode. 
- Due to the issue above, it is not possible to derive how a framework would behave with real-world production traffic from this test
- As with any benchmarking, it is always best to *test a simulation of your production traffic*

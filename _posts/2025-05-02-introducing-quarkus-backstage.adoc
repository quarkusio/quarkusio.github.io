== Introduction ==
DevOps, for many, has been more of a linguistic rebranding than a true cultural shift. All too often, organizations stop at renaming their Ops team to DevOps and call it a day. 
But without real collaboration, without mutual understanding between developers and operators there is no actual DevOps.
Today, we witness the rise of Platform Engineering which is supposed to improve developer experience and productivity and act as an enabler for DevOps.

The question is can this gap be bridged without tools that facilitate this collaboration?
Since, its early days Quarkus provided tools for developers that help them get closer to the Ops side of the house, but also communicate to the Ops what the 
dev actually needs. In this category we could classify the Quarkus Kubernetes and Helm extension. The latest addtion to this family of exntesion is now 
the https://docs.quarkiverse.io/quarkus-backstage/dev/index.html[Quarkus Backstage] extension that simplifies the integration of Quarkus and https://backstage.io[Backstage], one of the most prominent projects in the Platform Engineering space.


=== What is Backstage ? ===
https://backstage.io[Backstage] is an open framework for building developer portals. It was originally created by Spotify to help their engineers manage the complexity of Microservices and cloud-native architectures.
It builds developer portals that act as software component registries, allowing teams to easily

* Track component ownership
* Discover, explore and document services
* Communicate API changes
* Create and instantiate Software Templates (materializing DevOps practices)
* Aggregate all developer consoles in one place
and more


=== Backstage Challenges ===
The idea is not new. I've seen similar tools come and go throughout my whole professional life. What makes https://backstage.io[Backstage] more relevant is the adoption of Microservice Architecture, which increases the 
amplifies the need for a developer portal. What's also not new is the challenge of using such a tool and making in it an integral part of the developer workflow.

As always the challenge is the maintenance cost.
Maintenance, in terms of keeping the information served by https://backstage.io[Backstage] up to date.

What happens when a Service adds / removes an API ? 
What happens when an API is migrated to new transport protocol ? 
What happens when we need to use a new framework version in our templates ?

A development practice is as good as the tools that make it stick.


=== Quarkus Backstage Features ===
How does https://docs.quarkiverse.io/quarkus-backstage/dev/index.html[Quarkus Backstage] help with the challenges above ?

Short answer: By making Quarkus the Platform Engineers favorite application framework.
Long answer: While it's out of scope to solve all the challenges of https://backstage.io[Backstage], Quarkus aids the Platform Engineer in the following ways:

* Generates Component and API entities for Quarkus applications
* Reverse engineers Templates from existing Quarkus applications
* Provides CLI for managing https://backstage.io[Backstage] entities
* Provides Dev Services for https://backstage.io[Backstage]
* Acts as a coordinator for all Quarkus DevOps extensions  


=== Using Quarkus Backstage ===
https://docs.quarkiverse.io/quarkus-backstage/dev/index.html[Quarkus Backstage] comes in two shapes that can be used independently:

* Quarkus CLI plugin
* Quarkus extension


==== As a CLI plugin ====
Let's see how to use the https://docs.quarkiverse.io/quarkus-backstage/dev/index.html[Quarkus Backstage] CLI plugin in order to generate https://backstage.io[Backstage] entities for your Quarkus application.

First, let's create a new Quarkus project:
[source,shell]
----
quarkus create app hello-backstage -x rest
----

....
Looking for the newly published extensions in registry.quarkus.io
-----------
selected extensions: 
- io.quarkus:quarkus-rest


applying codestarts...
📚 java
🔨 maven
📦 quarkus
📝 config-properties
🔧 tooling-dockerfiles
🔧 tooling-maven-wrapper
🚀 rest-codestart

-----------
[SUCCESS] ✅  quarkus project has been successfully generated in:
--> /home/iocanel/blog/hello-backstage
-----------
Navigate into this directory and get started: quarkus dev
....



Then, navigate to the project directory:

From within your Quarkus project, run the following command:

[source,shell]
----
quarkus plugin add io.quarkiverse.backstage:quarkus-backstage-cli:0.7.0
----

....
Looking for the newly published extensions in registry.quarkus.io
Added plugin:
    Name      	 Type  	 Scope   	 Location                                             	 Description 	
 *  backstage 	 maven 	 project 	 io.quarkiverse.backstage:quarkus-backstage-cli:0.7.0 	             	
....


If you want to install it globally and make it available for all your Quarkus projects, run the following command:

[source,shell]
----
quarkus plugin add io.quarkiverse.backstage:quarkus-backstage-cli:0.7.0 --user
----

....
Added plugin:
    Name      	 Type  	 Scope 	 Location                                             	 Description 	
 *  backstage 	 maven 	 user  	 io.quarkiverse.backstage:quarkus-backstage-cli:0.7.0 	             	
....


To get an idea of the available commands, run:
[source,shell]
----
quarkus backstage --help
----

....
Backstage CLI
Usage: backstage [-h] [COMMAND]
  -h, --help   Display this help message.
Commands:
  entities  Backstage Entities
  location  Backstage Location
  template  Backstage Template
  mcp       Start backstage MCP server.
....


To generate a https://backstage.io[Backstage] entities for your Quarkus application, run the following command:

[source,shell]
----
quarkus backstage entities generate
----

....
Backstage entities generated:
 API Version           	 Kind                  	 Name            	 UUID 	
 backstage.io/v1alpha1 	 Component             	 hello-backstage 	      	

....



[source,shell]
----
cat catalog-info.yaml
----

....
 
apiVersion: backstage.io/v1alpha1
kind: Component
spec:
  type: application
  lifecycle: production
  owner: user:guest
metadata:
  name: hello-backstage
  labels:
    app.kubernetes.io/name: hello-backstage
    app.kubernetes.io/version: 1.0.0-SNAPSHOT
    app.quarkus.io/version: 3.18.3
  tags:
  - java
  - quarkus
....

The generated component is available under the `catalog-info.yaml`. The file can
be added to git, pushed to a git repository and then registered in Backstage.

Pretty much any Backstage installation should be able to read the component from github.
To do the registration, starting from the Home screen:

* Click on the "Create" button
* Click on "Register existing component"
* Paste the link to the `catalog-info.yaml` file in the git repository
* Click on "Analyze"
* Click on "Register"  

The registered component should look like:

image::hello-backstage-component-view.png[scaledwidth=100%]

This is not very impressive given that the file could be generated by Backstage itself.
However, that would be the last thing that Backstage would do for you. 
What would happen next time your application changes and changes need to be reflected in Backstage ?

Let's expose an API for our application. We'll add the openapi extension and we'll configure it so
that it generates the openapi schema in the same directory as the `catalog-info.yaml` file.

[source,shell]
----
quarkus ext add smallrye-openapi
quarkus config set quarkus.smallrye-openapi.store-schema-directory .
----

....
Looking for the newly published extensions in registry.quarkus.io
[SUCCESS] ✅  Extension io.quarkus:quarkus-smallrye-openapi has been installed
....


Let's rebuild the application and see how our `catalog-info.yaml` file looks like:

[source,shell]
----
cat catalog-info.yaml
----

....
 
apiVersion: backstage.io/v1alpha1
kind: API
spec:
  type: openapi
  lifecycle: production
  owner: user:guest
  definition:
    $text: ./openapi.yaml
metadata:
  name: hello-backstage-api
--- 
apiVersion: backstage.io/v1alpha1
kind: Component
spec:
  type: application
  lifecycle: production
  owner: user:guest
  providesApis:
  - hello-backstage-api
metadata:
  name: hello-backstage
  labels:
    app.kubernetes.io/name: hello-backstage
    app.kubernetes.io/version: 1.0.0-SNAPSHOT
    app.quarkus.io/version: 3.18.3
  tags:
  - java
  - quarkus
....

The refreshed component now looks like:

image::hello-backstage-component-with-api-view.png[scaledwidth=100%]


==== As an extension ====
An alternative to using the https://docs.quarkiverse.io/quarkus-backstage/dev/index.html[Quarkus Backstage] CLI plugin is to use the https://docs.quarkiverse.io/quarkus-backstage/dev/index.html[Quarkus Backstage] extension.
Usually, an extension is needed when the application itself requires a library, a framework, or a code
generator. In this case, the extension adds the Backstage entity generation to the application build process.

To add the extension to the project:

[source,shell]
----
quarkus ext add io.quarkiverse.backstage:quarkus-backstage:0.7.0
----

....
[SUCCESS] ✅  Extension io.quarkiverse.backstage:quarkus-backstage:0.7.0 has been installed
....


At the time of writing the extension is not part of the Extension catalog, and thus it needs to be added using
its full maven coordinates.

Now, let's remove the existing `catalog-info.yaml` file and let's generate a new one using the extension:

[source,shell]
----
rm catalog-info.yaml
ls -al
----

....

drwxr-xr-x 4 iocanel users  4096 Apr  3 19:21 target
....


Finally, let's rebuild:

And check that the file is properly generated. The generated resources should the same as the ones generated by the CLI plugin.
There is still value in using the extension, but that's a subject for another blog post.


=== Conclusion ===
https://backstage.io[Backstage] is a great tool for organizations to survive the Microservice Architecture chaos.
A tool, can't help if it's not used nor if it's feed with stale data.
The https://docs.quarkiverse.io/quarkus-backstage/dev/index.html[Quarkus Backstage] project was created to leverage the power of the Quarkus build system in order to keep
the catalog entities of Quarkus components up to date. In Quarkus lingo, to bring "Platform Engineer joy".

A video walk-through on the basics of the extension is available at https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XAiF-opDtpw[here].

From its inception, Quarkus has offered the ability to compile Java
applications into native binaries. This feature is crucial for achieving rapid
startup times and reduced memory consumption, two properties that remain
paramount to Quarkus' mission and that Quarkus remains committed to.

We have already started preparing for the adoption of GraalVM 25 (via our
Mandrel distribution), and expect to switch to it as the primary native builder
in the near future.

Quarkus uses the Mandrel GraalVM distribution to ensure continuity of updates
on native-image capabilities. https://quarkus.io/blog/mandrel-25-released[Mandrel 25] empowers Quarkus
users to leverage the latest JDK innovations (JDK 25) and target cloud-native
deployments through its native compilation capabilities. Our collaboration with
the upstream GraalVM community during GraalVM 25’s development has strengthened
our involvement, bringing these shared innovations directly to Quarkus users
with the incorporation of the Mandrel 25 release.

Key improvements that Mandrel 25 and Quarkus are expected to bring:

* **Readiness for JDK 25 - Enhanced Compatibility and Stability:** Mandrel 25,
  based on OpenJDK 25, offers improved compatibility with the latest OpenJDK
  features and libraries, ensuring that Quarkus applications can leverage the
  full spectrum of the Java ecosystem while maintaining the stability and
  reliability expected of production-ready enterprise systems.
* **Continued Focus on Key Metrics:** Mandrel 25 will be the technology of
  choice in order to deliver on the cloud-native performance goals of fast
  startup and low memory footprint of Quarkus releases for the next years to
  come. Quarkus continues to enable aggressive initialization at built time to
  achieve this.
* **Enhanced Static Analysis Accuracy:** GraalVM 25 enables https://github.com/oracle/graal/pull/9821[Whole-Program
  Sparse Conditional Constant Propagation (WP-SCCP)] by default, improving the
  precision of points-to analysis in native image. This optimization enhances
  static analysis accuracy and scalability, potentially reducing the size of the
  final native binary.
  https://medium.com/graalvm/skipflow-producing-smaller-executables-with-graalvm-f18ca98279c2[More information on the GraalVM blog].
* **Improved Error Reporting and Diagnostics:** When resources or certain
  reflective accesses aren't properly registered at image build time, it is now
  being appropriately flagged by raising a specific exception when building with
  Mandrel 25. Flags, `-XX:MissingRegistrationReportingMode=Warn` and
  `-XX:MissingRegistrationWarnContextLines=<#lines>` can be used to diagnose. The
  ability to handle `OutOfMemoryError` was added.
* **Enhanced Monitoring Possibilities:** By leveraging Mandrel 25 more
  monitoring options of the deployed native Quarkus application binary become
  possible closing the gap between JVM mode and native mode. New JFR events, such
  as Socket IO and native memory tracking events as well as JFR allocation
  profiling becomes possible (via the `jdk.ObjectAllocationSample` event). The
  addition of https://www.graalvm.org/jdk25/reference-manual/native-image/debugging-and-diagnostics/jcmd/[Java Diagnostic Command]
  (JCMD) allows for triggering of certain actions on the running native image.
  The JFR monitoring feature of native image has been enhanced to be more
  configurable (via `-XX:FlightRecorderOptions`), previously only available in
  JVM mode. Native memory tracking can be optionally enabled in order to diagnose
  memory leaks (using `-Dquarkus.native.monitoring=nmt` at build time and
  `-XX:+PrintNMTStatistics` at runtime)
* **Full Support for the Foreign Function & Memory (FFM) API:** Quarkus
  applications can now make use of full support of the FFM API (included in JVM
  mode since JDK 22) when compiling to native using Mandrel 25. Upcall and
  downcall support has been added for all supported Quarkus operating systems and
  architectures.

By seamlessly integrating Mandrel 25, and Quarkus’ continued focus on developer
joy and productivity, together with new and emerging AI capabilities further
solidifies Quarkus position as the premier framework for building
high-performance, cloud-native Java applications. Developers can confidently
leverage these advancements to deploy applications that are not only efficient
but also deliver exceptional user experiences. Quarkus and Mandrel 25 combine
to create a powerful synergy that pushes the boundaries of Java in today's
modern computing landscape. This combination delivers on Quarkus’s Cloud Native
Mission, offering swift start-up times and a low memory footprint.


[[looking-ahead]]
== Looking Ahead

Beyond GraalVM 25, we are tracking the evolution of GraalVM closely as we have
done in the past and will continue to work with the GraalVM team to evolve
accordingly and ensure that Quarkus integrates well with it. We are looking
forward to exciting new features, not least:

1. https://github.com/oracle/graal/issues/12237[Shenandoah GC] integration
2. https://github.com/oracle/graal/issues/11327[Project Crema] and dynamic
   Java on top of native-image. This will unlock Java use cases that today
   cannot run as native-image
3. https://github.com/oracle/graal/issues/7626[Native Image Layers] to make
   it possible to tune performance vs. usability
4. Polyglot - First-class https://www.graalvm.org/jdk25/reference-manual/js/[JavaScript],
   https://www.graalvm.org/python/[Python] and
   https://www.graalvm.org/webassembly/docs/[Wasm] integrations

[[community-collab]]
== GraalVM Community Collaboration and GraalVM Summit

The collaboration between Quarkus, Mandrel and GraalVM developers continues to
be strong. What’s more, Mandrel is being developed as part of the GraalVM
Github organization and the GraalVM for JDK 21 community effort was established
as part of those community gatherings. Mandrel developers assumed maintainer
roles for the https://github.com/graalvm/graalvm-community-jdk21u/[GraalVM
for JDK 21 maintenance repository]. We hope to establish a similar model for
GraalVM 25 and its downstream, Mandrel 25. The Mandrel team is certainly
interested in stepping up for community maintenance of GraalVM 25 when the time
comes.

For the past few years Quarkus and Mandrel developers have been attending the
GraalVM Community summit. A powerful platform to exchange ideas and experience
with the GraalVM technology. In 2025, five Quarkus/Mandrel developers attended
the GraalVM Community Summit. We believe the event was a great success. These
gatherings are tantamount to the Quarkus and GraalVM collaboration. We were
glad to see that there is shared interest in making the public
https://github.com/oracle/graal/[GraalVM github repository] a true upstream
with an open governance model. This would further strengthen the GraalVM
community and would help self-sustain certain areas.  Some of this has been
already tested with the
https://github.com/graalvm/graalvm-community-jdk21u/[GraalVM for JDK 21
upstream] community repository.

[[commitment-to-subatomic-java]]
== Commitment to delivering "Supersonic Subatomic Java"

The Quarkus project will continue to evaluate and incorporate the best
available technologies to ensure its users benefit from optimal reliability,
performance, and efficiency. This includes exploring advancements in all
technologies and runtime environments as they evolve, such as project Leyden.
Our goal remains to ensure that Quarkus remains at the forefront of
cloud-native Java development. Our commitment is to provide developers with the
flexibility to choose the tools that best fit their project's needs, while
always delivering on our promise of "Supersonic Subatomic Java", and provide
optimal, highly efficient deployment formats for a broad range of environments.

Onward with Quarkus Native!

Clement Escoffier's blog post "Strengthening the Release Process for Quarkiverse and SmallRye" outlines a corrected vulnerability in the SmallRye release process and a more secure release pipeline for SmallRye and Quarkiverse repositories. Learn about organizing a microservices codebase with Beans, EJB concepts, and the Repository pattern and touch upon automated testing using REST Assured and Quarkus JUnit5 in "Organizing Microservices with EJB, Beans, and Testing in Quarkus" by @Harsh. Read "Build containerized applications for Amazon DocumentDB that run on Amazon ECS on AWS Fargate" by Sourav Biswas and Varma Gottumukkala, to explore the fundamentals of building containerized applications for Amazon DocumentDB using Quarkus with the Panache ORM library. Clojure can be integrated into a Quarkus app to create dynamic routes easily. By connecting the two ecosystems, a basic routing system is set up. Explore more possibilities with Clojure and Quarkus on this foundation in "Calling Clojure from Java using a real example (Clojure + Quarkus)" by Gustavo Camargo. SmallRye OpenAPI in Quarkus is like having an intelligent intern managing API documentation as you code. Check out "The Power of SmallRye OpenAPI in Quarkus: A Developer's Guide to Effortless API Documentation" by suddo to learn how to implement this feature.

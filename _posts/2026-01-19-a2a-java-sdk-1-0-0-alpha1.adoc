I am pleased to announce the release of https://github.com/a2aproject/a2a-java/releases/tag/v1.0.0.Alpha1[A2A Java SDK 1.0.0.Alpha1]. This release represents a significant milestone as we align with the upcoming 1.0 version of the https://github.com/a2aproject/A2A[Agent2Agent (A2A) Protocol specification]. Note that the specification itself is still being finalised, so there might be some subtle changes until the final 1.0 version.

The A2A Protocol enables standardized communication between AI agents, allowing them to discover capabilities, delegate tasks, and collaborate seamlessly. This SDK provides a robust Java implementation for building both agents and clients that participate in the A2A ecosystem.

== Why 1.0 Matters

The move to version 1.0 of the A2A specification marks its transition from experimental to production-ready. As the specification matures, we've taken the opportunity to clean up technical debt, modernize our implementation, and establish patterns that will serve us well into the future.

*This release contains breaking changes.* We made the deliberate decision not to maintain backward compatibility with the 0.3.x series, as 1.0 represents the first "proper" release of the specification. This allows us to build on a solid foundation without carrying forward legacy patterns.

== Major Changes

=== 1. Specification Alignment

The SDK now implements protocol version `1.0` and aligns with the latest https://github.com/a2aproject/A2A/blob/main/specification/grpc/a2a.proto[a2a.proto] definitions. Key specification changes include:

* *AgentCard evolution*: The `AgentCard` now uses a `supportedInterfaces` list instead of separate `url`, `preferredTransport`, and `additionalInterfaces` fields. This provides a cleaner, more flexible way to advertise multiple protocol bindings.
* *Removed kind discriminators*: The 1.0 specification eliminates the `kind` field as a type discriminator, simplifying the protocol.
* *Refined error handling*: Error classes have been reworked to match the 1.0 specification's error model.

=== 2. Modern Java: Standardized on Records

The entire `spec` module has been modernized to use Java records consistently. Previously, we had a mix of traditional classes and records across our domain model. Now all domain classes leverage records for immutability and conciseness, and all getters follow the same naming pattern:

[source,java]
----
// Before (0.3.x): Mix of classes and records with inconsistent patterns
public class AgentCard {  // Some were classes
    private final String name;
    public String getName() { return name; }  // JavaBean-style getters
}

public record AgentSkill(String id, String name, ...) { }  // Some were already records
// Accessor: skill.name() without 'get' prefix

// After (1.0.x): Consistent records throughout
public record AgentCard(
    String name,
    String description,
    AgentProvider provider,
    String version,
    List<AgentInterface> supportedInterfaces,
    String protocolVersion) {

    public static final String CURRENT_PROTOCOL_VERSION = "1.0";
}

public record AgentSkill(String id, String name, String description, ...) { }

// Uniform accessor pattern throughout: card.name(), skill.name()
----

This standardization eliminates confusion and reduces boilerplate while providing a cleaner, more maintainable API.

 The A2A Java SDK has seen significant improvements in type safety and **null-safety** through progressive adoption of JSpecify annotations over the past few months. This effort demonstrates the project's commitment to code quality and preventing null pointer exceptions at compile time.

==== Builder Pattern with Static Factory Methods

All builders now use static factory methods instead of public constructors. This provides better encapsulation and follows modern Java best practices:

[source,java]
----
// Before (0.3.x): Public builder constructor
AgentCard card = new AgentCard.Builder()
    .name("My Agent")
    .description("Does things")
    .build();

// After (1.0.x): Static factory method
AgentCard card = AgentCard.builder()  <1>
    .name("My Agent")
    .description("Does things")
    .version("1.0.0")
    .capabilities(AgentCapabilities.builder()  <2>
        .streaming(true)
        .pushNotifications(false)
        .build())
    .defaultInputModes(List.of("text"))
    .defaultOutputModes(List.of("text"))
    .skills(List.of(
        AgentSkill.builder()  <3>
            .id("weather_query")
            .name("Weather Queries")
            .description("Get current weather")
            .build()
    ))
    .supportedInterfaces(List.of(
        new AgentInterface("JSONRPC", "http://localhost:9999")
    ))
    .protocolVersion(AgentCard.CURRENT_PROTOCOL_VERSION)
    .build();
----
<1> `AgentCard.builder()` creates the builder - constructor is now private
<2> Nested builders also use static factory methods
<3> All spec classes follow this pattern consistently

Builder constructors are now private in the declaring classes, enforcing the use of the static factory method pattern throughout the SDK.

=== 3. Protocol Buffers as Source of Truth

We've eliminated our dependency on Jackson and established protocol buffers (protobuf) as the authoritative source for our domain model. The architecture is straightforward:

* *Protobuf definitions* in `a2a.proto` define the wire format
* *Java records* in the `spec` module provide the SDK's API
* *MapStruct mappers* handle conversions, giving compile errors if protobuf and spec classes go out of sync
* *Gson* handles JSON serialization for JSON-RPC transport

This provides type safety across all transports, a single source of truth for the protocol, and clean separation between wire format and API without cluttering domain classes with serialization annotations.

=== 4. Bill of Materials (BOMs)

We've introduced Maven BOMs to simplify dependency management:

[source,xml]
----
<dependencyManagement>
    <dependencies>
        <dependency>
            <groupId>io.github.a2asdk</groupId>
            <artifactId>a2a-java-sdk-bom</artifactId>
            <version>1.0.0.Alpha1</version>
            <type>pom</type>
            <scope>import</scope>
        </dependency>
    </dependencies>
</dependencyManagement>
----

Three BOMs are available:

* `a2a-java-sdk-bom`: Core SDK and client libraries
* `a2a-java-extras-bom`: Optional extensions (JpaDatabaseTaskStore and -PushNotificationStore, replicated QueueManager, Vert.X HTTP client)
* `a2a-java-reference-bom`: Quarkus reference implementations

This eliminates version management headaches when using multiple SDK modules, and their dependencies.

=== 5. Enhanced API Documentation

Every class in the `spec` module now has comprehensive Javadoc explaining its purpose, usage, and relationship to the A2A specification. We've also added detailed documentation for integration points in `server-common` and all client modules.

=== 6. Additional Improvements

* *Pagination support*: The `ListTasks` and push notification configuration endpoints now support pagination with proper `Result` wrappers
* *Pluggable HTTP client*: A new `A2AHttpClient` interface allows custom HTTP implementations, with a Vert.x-based implementation provided
* *Better validation*: Enhanced input validation across all transports
* *TCK progress*: Continuous work towards full compliance with the 1.0 Test Compatibility Kit. The TCK is also work in progress, while the specification is being finalised.

== Breaking Changes Summary

If you're migrating from 0.3.x, here are the key breaking changes:

1. *AgentCard structure*: Replace `url` + `preferredTransport` with `supportedInterfaces` list
2. *Builder pattern*: Use `AgentCard.builder()` instead of `new AgentCard.Builder()` - applies to all spec classes
3. *Protocol version*: Update to `AgentCard.CURRENT_PROTOCOL_VERSION` (now `"1.0"`)
4. *Field renames*: `supportsAuthenticatedExtendedCard` → `supportsExtendedAgentCard`
5. *Getter naming*: Records use `card.name()` instead of `card.getName()`
6. *Package cleanup*: The `io.a2a.apec` package has been trimmed
7. *Serialization*: If you relied on Jackson annotations, migrate to Gson patterns

== Getting Started

Creating an agent requires producing an `AgentCard` and an `AgentExecutor`. The `@PublicAgentCard` qualifier marks the public agent card that serves as the entry point for discovery - this is what clients retrieve when discovering your agent. You can also provide an extended agent card with additional authenticated information. Here's a minimal example:

[source,java]
----
@ApplicationScoped
public class MyAgentCardProducer {
    @Produces @PublicAgentCard
    public AgentCard agentCard() {
        return AgentCard.builder()
            .name("Weather Agent")
            .description("Provides weather information")
            .version("1.0.0")
            .capabilities(AgentCapabilities.builder()
                .streaming(true)
                .pushNotifications(false)
                .build())
            .defaultInputModes(List.of("text"))
            .defaultOutputModes(List.of("text"))
            .skills(List.of(
                AgentSkill.builder()
                    .id("weather_query")
                    .name("Weather Queries")
                    .description("Get current weather for a location")
                    .build()
            ))
            .protocolVersion(AgentCard.CURRENT_PROTOCOL_VERSION)
            .supportedInterfaces(List.of(
                new AgentInterface("JSONRPC", "http://localhost:9999")
            ))
            .build();
    }
}

@ApplicationScoped
public class MyAgentExecutorProducer {
    @Produces
    public AgentExecutor agentExecutor() {
        return new MyAgentExecutor();
    }

    private static class MyAgentExecutor implements AgentExecutor {
        @Override
        public void execute(RequestContext context, EventQueue eventQueue) {
            TaskUpdater updater = new TaskUpdater(context, eventQueue);
            updater.submit();
            updater.startWork();

            // Your agent logic here
            String response = "Current weather: Sunny, 72°F";

            updater.addArtifact(List.of(new TextPart(response, null)));
            updater.complete();
        }
    }
}

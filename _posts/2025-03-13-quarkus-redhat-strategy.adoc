Over the past weeks, we've received questions about the https://www.redhat.com/en/blog/evolving-our-middleware-strategy[recent announcement] that Red Hat's Middleware engineering and product teams, which include Quarkus, are moving to IBM.

We want to take this opportunity to acknowledge this change while reaffirming what has always been true:

*Quarkus is an open-source project driven by a global community of contributors, spanning companies, individuals, and open-source enthusiasts.*

From its inception, Quarkus has been shaped by *real-world adoption* across industries, with companies https://quarkus.io/userstories/[sharing their user-stories], leveraging Quarkus's unmatched performance and developer joy in the Java ecosystem. We recently celebrated our https://quarkus.io/1000contributors/[*1000th contributor milestone*], a testament to the strength of this diverse and thriving community.

Speaking as Quarkus contributors employed by Red Hat and soon IBM, we love our project and intend to keep making it awesome. IBM and Red Hat have clearly communicated that the current and future contributions to Quarkus are a key component of the middleware strategy. IBM has already been an active contributor to Quarkus, and we look forward to increased contribution - alongside the many other individuals and companies who contribute, innovate, and drive Quarkus forward.

Additionally, *Quarkus is already on the path to becoming part of https://www.commonhaus.org/[Commonhaus] an open-source foundation*, further ensuring its long-term independence and success as a truly community-driven project. The move to the foundation and the Red Hat/IBM move could look suspicious timing-wise, but the two are unrelated. We described our reasons in a https://quarkus.io/blog/quarkus-in-a-foundation/[previous blog post], but if anything, this announcement reaffirms the importance of a foundation-hosted project for its stability. 

To our contributors and users: your involvement has always been what makes Quarkus thrive. Keep building, experimenting, and shaping the future of Java with us.

*-- The Quarkus Team*

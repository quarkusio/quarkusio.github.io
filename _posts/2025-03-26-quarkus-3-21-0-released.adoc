Today, together with https://quarkus.io/blog/quarkus-3-20-0-released/[Quarkus 3.20 LTS], we released Quarkus 3.21.

Whereas Quarkus 3.20 LTS is the direct continuation of Quarkus 3.19, Quarkus 3.21 comes with new features.

It comes with a lot of small enhancements and the support for the TLS Registry in the MongoDB Client extension.

== Update

To update to Quarkus 3.21, we recommend updating to the latest version of the Quarkus CLI and run:

[source,bash]
----
quarkus update
----

Note that `quarkus update` can update your applications from any version of Quarkus (including 2.x) to Quarkus 3.21.

For more information about the adjustments you need to make to your applications, please refer to the https://github.com/quarkusio/quarkus/wiki/Migration-Guide-3.21[Quarkus 3.21 migration guide].

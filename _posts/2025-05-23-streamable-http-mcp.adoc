The Model Context Protocol (MCP) is taking the developer world by storm, and now, with its latest spec update, it's breaking new ground: Streamable HTTP support has arrived! We're thrilled to announce that Quarkus MCP Server is the very first Java-based MCP server to embrace this innovation, making it easier than ever for you to build, experiment, and deploy MCP-powered solutions—wherever you need them.

With the release of [Quarkus MCP Server 1.2](https://github.com/quarkiverse/quarkus-mcp-server/releases/tag/1.2.0), Streamable HTTP joins `stdio` and `SSE` as supported transports. This means you can now connect your MCP servers to a wider range of clients and platforms, from mobile apps to cloud-native services, all with the power and flexibility of Java and Quarkus.

== Why Streamable HTTP Matters

Streamable HTTP is the approach MCP spec have taken for real-time, efficient, and scalable communication between clients and servers. It opens the door to new integrations and user experiences, especially for platforms and devices where traditional transports like SSE or stdio aren't ideal.

And now, thanks to Quarkus MCP Server, Java developers are at the forefront of this evolution. Whether you're building AI assistants, developer tools, or next-gen chatbots, Streamable HTTP gives you the flexibility to reach more users, faster.

== Getting Started: Upgrade in Seconds

Ready to try it out? Upgrading is a breeze. Just update your Maven dependency to the latest Quarkus MCP Server SSE transport:

```xml
<dependency>
    <groupId>io.quarkiverse.mcp</groupId>
    <artifactId>quarkus-mcp-servers-sse</artifactId>
    <version>1.2.0</version>
</dependency>
```

That's it! You're now equipped to serve Streamable HTTP from your Java MCP server.

== Quarkus MCP Servers: Power and Simplicity

The Quarkus MCP Servers project (https://github.com/quarkiverse/quarkus-mcp-servers) brings a suite of ready-to-use MCP servers, all built on Quarkus. With version 1.0.0.CR4, streamable HTTP support is baked in—no extra configuration required. We just updated the dependency, and it was ready to go!

To enable Streamable HTTP, simply launch any server in Quarkus MCP Servers with the `--sse` flag:

```
jbang jvminsight@mcp-java --sse
```

== Connecting Clients: The Future is Now

The default URL for Streamable HTTP is:

    http://<your-ip>:8080/mcp/

(For SSE, use `http://<your-ip>:8080/mcp/sse` as before.)

While Streamable HTTP is still new, some pioneering clients already support it. Notably, the open source iOS app [ChatMCP](https://github.com/daodao97/chatmcp) (available on [TestFlight](https://testflight.apple.com/join/dCXksFJV)) and a non-open source version on the [iOS App Store](https://apps.apple.com/dk/app/chatmcp/id6745196560) both work seamlessly with MCP and require Streamable HTTP.

Here's a quick demo of ChatMCP in action with the jvminsight server:

== Kotlin: Lightweight and Fun

Quarkus isn't just for Java—its Kotlin support means you can build MCP servers in a modern, expressive language. Want to experiment? Here's a playful example of a Kotlin MCP server you can run instantly with JBang. It fetches a random image from https://picsum.photos/ and returns it as a base64-encoded image, just as the MCP spec requires.

```kotlin
///usr/bin/env jbang "$0" "$@" ; exit $?

//KOTLIN
//DEPS io.quarkus:quarkus-bom:${quarkus.version:3.20.0}@pom
//DEPS io.quarkiverse.mcp.servers:mcp-server-shared:1.0.0.CR4

import io.quarkiverse.mcp.server.*
import java.net.URL
import java.util.Base64.getEncoder
import kotlin.io.readBytes

class demo {

   @Tool(description = "Get a random picture")
   fun randomimage(@ToolArg(description = "seed for randomness") seed: String,
                   @ToolArg(description = "width", defaultValue = "300") width: Int,
                   @ToolArg(description = "height", defaultValue = "300") height : Int): ImageContent {

      val image = URL("https://picsum.photos/seed/$seed/$width/$height").readBytes()

      return ImageContent(
         getEncoder().encodeToString(image),
         "image/jpeg"
      )
   }
}
```

Save this as `demo.kt` and run it with:

```
jbang demo.kt --sse
```

You can now use the `randomimage` tool in ChatMCP or any other MCP client that supports Streamable HTTP. It's that easy—and a great way to start experimenting!

== Conclusion: Join the Streamable Revolution

Streamable HTTP is an important step for the MCP ecosystem, and Quarkus MCP Server is putting Java developers in the driver's seat. Whether you're building tools, bots, or entirely new experiences, now's the perfect time to dive in and see what you can create.

We can't wait to see what you build. Try it out, share your feedback, and help shape the future of MCP—powered by Quarkus!

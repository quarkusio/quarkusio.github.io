## Hibernate Search + Elasticsearch (Preview)

`quarkus.hibernate-search.elasticsearch.automatic-indexing.synchronization.strategy` has been renamed to `quarkus.hibernate-search.automatic-indexing.synchronization.strategy`.

If you are using our Hibernate Search + Elasticsearch extension, there's a good chance you will need to adjust your configuration.

## Neo4j (Preview)

The Neo4j driver was updated to the Final 4.0 version and they have renamed a few classes, most notably `org.neo4j.driver.reactive.RxResult.RxStatementResult` has been renamed to `org.neo4j.driver.reactive.RxResult`.

## Gradle plugin

We now recommend using Gradle 6.0.1+. Starting from this version the Gradle plugin is no longer deployed in Maven Central, therefore some minor changes in your Gradle project might be needed. 

### Changes in the `settings.gradle` file

Let's start by changing the `settings.gradle` file. It should be changed from (`rootProject.name` value may vary depending on your project name):

```gradle
pluginManagement {
    repositories {
        mavenLocal()
        mavenCentral()
        gradlePluginPortal()
    }
    resolutionStrategy {
        eachPlugin {
            if (requested.id.id == 'io.quarkus') {
                useModule("io.quarkus:quarkus-gradle-plugin:1.0.1.Final")
            }
        }
    }
}

rootProject.name='my-project'
```
to: 
```gradle
pluginManagement {
    repositories {
        mavenLocal()
        mavenCentral()
        gradlePluginPortal()
    }
    plugins {
      id 'io.quarkus' version "${quarkusPluginVersion}"
    }
}
rootProject.name='my-project'
```

NOTE: the `plugins{}` method is not supported in Gradle 5.x. In this case make sure to explicitly declare the plugin version in the `build.gradle` file.

### Changes in the `build.gradle` file

Change your `build.gradle` file to use the plugin DSL format, from:

```gradle
// this block is necessary to make enforcedPlatform work for Quarkus plugin available
// only locally (snapshot) that is also importing the Quarkus BOM
buildscript {
    repositories {
        mavenLocal()
    }
    dependencies {
        classpath "io.quarkus:quarkus-gradle-plugin:${quarkusPluginVersion}"
    }
}

plugins {
    id 'java'
}

apply plugin: 'io.quarkus'
```
to: 
```gradle
plugins {
   id 'java'
   id 'io.quarkus'
}

```

## Extension framework

### Updated configuration framework

Our configuration framework got a big update to fix a number of issues all around.

The main consequence of this change is that you will need to mark optional collections and maps as `Optional` in your config classes (that means `Optional<List<String>>` for instance).

### GizmoAdaptor

The `GizmoAdaptor` class has been renamed to `GeneratedClassGizmoAdaptor`, due to the introduction of `GeneratedBeanGizmoAdaptor`.
